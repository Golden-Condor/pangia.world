      <h2>11. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
      <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms ("Dispute"), you and Pangia agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.</p>
      <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
      <p>If informal negotiations do not resolve the Dispute, the Dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration, conducted in North Carolina in English and governed by the substantive laws of that state.</p>
      <h3>Restrictions</h3>
      <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute between the Parties individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law: (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
      <h3>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h3>
      <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions regarding informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above. The Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
