  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work.

  <h2>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
  <p>
    We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information for security, site functionality, and analytics. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our <a href="/pages/cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a>.<br>
    Google Analytics may collect usage data; opt out at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s opt-out</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>
    We keep your information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information.
  </p>

  <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
  <p>
    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
  </p>

  <h2>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello.world@pangia.world">hello.world@pangia.world</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
  <p>
    In some regions (like the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Canada), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time. You may also withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us. See our <a href="/pages/cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a> to manage cookies.
  </p>

  <h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
  <p>
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
  </p>

  <h2>10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
  <p>
    If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, or Virginia, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information. These may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right to know/access/correct/delete your data</li>
    <li>Right to non-discrimination for exercising your rights</li>
    <li>Right to opt out of targeted advertising or data sale (not applicable here)</li>
  </ul>
